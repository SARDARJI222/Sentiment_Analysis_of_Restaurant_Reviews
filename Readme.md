# Sentiment_Analysis_of_Restaurant_Reviews

## Overview

Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews
This repository contains code for sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews using three different machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The models have achieved an accuracy of 70% on the provided dataset.

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we focus on restaurant reviews and employ machine learning algorithms to predict the sentiment of these reviews. The implemented algorithms include Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models is provided in the data directory. It includes a collection of restaurant reviews labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive or negative).

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the application:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- NLP
